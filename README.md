# Fix-Bad-Arrow-Keys-in-60-Keyboards
This hotkey script is aimed  to solve bad arrow key implementation on 60% formfactor keyboards. A lot of keyboards suffer from this issue, especially cheap keyboards.

### Features

1. Support for one hand mode using `L`, `,`, `.`, `/` and `Appskey (AKA Right Click On Keyboard) ` to activate the arrow keys hold press `Appskey` and now your `L`, `,`, `.`, `/` are the arrow keys.
2. Support for two hand mode using `W`,`A`,`S`,`D ` they activate the same way above just hold press `Appskey`.
3. The two mods are supported at the same time when you press `Appskey` Both `L`, `,`, `.`, `/` and `W`,`A`,`S`,`D` can be used.
4. Because we mapped `Appskey` to activate the arrow keys it's now unavaliable to be used as is, now it's mapped to `CTRL` + `Appskey`.
